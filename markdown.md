# {{page.title}}

<p> The overriding design goal for <i> Markdown</i>’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is a <i> Markdown </i> formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. </p>

<p> The philosophy behind <i> Markdown </i> is that plain text documents should be readable without tags mussing everything up. You can use <i> Markdown </i> to add formatting elements to plaintext documents. </p>

### Markdown Syntax

| Element | Syntax |
|---|:---:|
| Heading Level 1 | # |
| Heading Level 2 | ## |
| Paragraph | <p> |
| Bold | ** |
| Italic | * |
| Unordered List | - |
| Ordered List | any number |
| Link | [link text](link URL) |

#### Best Practices

- Always put a space between the number signs (#) and the heading name.
- Unless the paragraph is in a list, don’t indent paragraphs with spaces or tabs.
- For Line break, use trailing white space at the end of the line.
- Put blank lines before and after horizontal rules.
